# This file describes the plugin initialization priority #
#							 #
##########################################################

# EXAMPLE:
#
# - plugin_A
# - plugin_B
# - plugin_C
# - plugin_A
# - plugin_A
# - plugin_D
#
# Plugins can be initialized in a configured order.
#
# The plugin init ordering is defined by the platform maintainer.
#
# Plugins can be initialized in phases: first initialize part a,
# wait for another plugin to initialize, then init part b, wait ...
#
# If a Plugin that is referenced in the initialization sequence is not present
# then it will be ignored and will continue with the next one in the list
#
# If a detected Plugin is not in the initialization list then it will be added
# to the bottom of the init sequence and only executed once (phase_id 0)
#
# If a Plugin is listed more than once in the initialization list then the
# init function will get called multiple times in the proper order, but each
# time it will pass a higher int phase_id value to express to the plugin which
# phase it should initialize.
